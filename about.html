        My name is Maria Kirkegaard Rasmussen. I live with my boyfriend and our cat in Brabrand, and I've been living in Aarhus for my entire life. I'm about half ways through my education as a multimediadesigner
        and I plan to study further as a web developer afterwards. I enjoy challenges and working on a task either together with a group or by myself.    
    </p>

    <h2>Why frontend development?</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in computers and gaming for as long as I remember, I've also always enjoyed drawing and taking photos, and I think these things combined is what started
        my interest in design and aesthethics. When I first heard about multimediadesign, it sounded absolutely perfect for me! I got to solve interesting tasks, as well as releasing my
        creativity. I originally wanted to work primarily with design, but when I actually started studying, I fell in love with programming and the feeling of satisfaction it gives you when you finally fix something
        after hours of hard work. That's when I decided that I wanted to be a web developer.
    </p>

    <h2>What skills do I have?</h2>
    <p>As stated before I specialize in coding and designing, and I also feel like these subjects are my biggest strengths. As a multimediadesigner I've tried working on many different kind of assignments and in many different ways, so I'm easily adaptable to new ways of solving problems.
        These are some of my skills as a multimediadesigner. </p>
