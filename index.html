        I'm a 22 year old Danish multimediadesignstudent at Business Academy Aarhus. I specialize in frontend development and designing, but I also do some artwork in my spare time.
        I want to work in a business where I can use my skills and creativity to create websites and designs that I'm proud of. 
        My biggest goal is to look at something awesome and go "Wow, I made that!"

        I'm currently looking for an internship, so feel free to look through my work and contact me if you find anything of interest.
