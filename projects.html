<h1>Some of my finished projects</h1>
    <h2>Grundfos prototype application - B2B project</h2>

    <img src="images/grundfosgif.gif" alt="Gif of the prototype">
    
    <p>
In this project we were assigned to make a prototype of an improved version of Grundfos' already existing application. 
We were to merge Ecademy (a learning platform) and Win&Earn (a way of earning prizes for digital points). This is the prototype my group came up with.

<h2>Expiration - Webapp project</h2>

<img src="images/expirationgif.gif" alt="Gif of the application">

<p>For this project we had to make a webapp. We made the app Expiration, 
which works as an inventory of the users fridge, as a shopping list and as a way for the user to keep track of the expiration dates of their food.</p>

<h2>Edutainment application - Steno museum project</h2>
<img src="images/stenogif.gif" alt="Gif of the application">

<p>We collaborated with the Steno museum, as they needed a digital solution for a way to engage the younger visitors towards the exhibitions. We wanted to make a quiz that was fun, 
    but also made you learn something, hence the term edutainment.
